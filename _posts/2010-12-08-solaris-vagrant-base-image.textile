We've been playing with Solaris a little bit recently on a new NAS, and wanted 
to get a little more familiar with it overall. Because Vagrant is such a great
way to manage little test env's, we figured we'd build a Solaris Express
2010/11 base box to play with. At this point in time you will need to use HEAD
Vagrant, however the next release will include our changes to make it work
properly. To give it a go, just create a Vagrantfile like this:

{% highlight ruby %}
Vagrant::Config.run do |config|
  config.vm.box = "sxp-201011"
  config.vm.box_url = "http://s3.lds.li/vagrant/sxp-201011.box"
  config.vm.system = :solaris
end
{% endhighlight %}

Then vagrant up, and vagrant ssh away. This image also has chef installed, so
you can use that to provision anything you want. This might also be useful
for people hosting on Joyent, and wanting to test things locally.
