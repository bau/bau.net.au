h1. This is the data for my site

It is automatically transformed by "Jekyll":http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll into a static site whenever I push this repository to GitHub by a post-commit script in "http://github.com/lstoll/services.lstoll.net/":http://github.com/lstoll/services.lstoll.net/

To get started, I copied Tom Preston-Werner's blog contents from http://github.com/mojombo/tpw , removed his posts/copyright material, and used that as a template. So a big props to him for both creating jekyll, and releasing his site code under the MIT license.
